# Laser-Cut-Creature
A laser cut monstrosity that appears to breath among other things

The wooden parts are made of 1/8" Baltic Birch, sanded with 220 grit sandpaper and polished with butcher block mineral oil to minimize friction.
The acrylic parts are 1/8" transparent acrylic.
Acrylic/wood and acrylic/acrylic bonds are made with clear binary epoxy
The ribs are cable ties cut to lengths that look right, held to the ribs with sleeves of 1/4" inside diameter clear vinyl tubing

This creature is assembled with M4-40 machine screws, secured with a  pair of nuts that have a locking washer in between. Still looking for a better way to make axles of arbitrary length quickly and easily.

The motor is a GM3 (https://solarbotics.com/product/gm3/) gearset modified with a high torque motor (https://solarbotics.com/product/rm2/)

The servo is a standard sized hobby servo (https://solarbotics.com/product/servo/)

The heartbeat light is an Adafruit NeoPixel Jewel (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226)

The control board is a Sketchboard (https://solarbotics.com/product/28922/ but Arduino Uno compatible will do) with a CMDR shield (https://solarbotics.com/product/39290/)
